                    <p>Spam has been an integral part of everyday food for Hawaii residents since it was introduced in 1937. Now, more than 80 years later, the salty slices of meat can be found on menus across the islands, served as spam musubi, spam fried rice, or the classic breakfast of spam, eggs, and rice. There’s even the annual <a href="https://spamjamhawaii.com" target="_blank">Waikiki Spam Jam</a>, a Spam-themed street festival in Honolulu celebrating people’s love for the canned meat with merchandise, spam-centric food stalls, and art displays.</p>

                    <p>But it turns out Hawaii is not the only state with an affinity for spam. The $3 canned meat is as popular as ever, with Hormel Foods reporting that Spam had its fifth consecutive year of record sales—that would be $220 million dollars in U.S. sales during 2019.</p>
                    <p>Its popularity has spawned <a href="https://www.spam.com/varieties" target="_blank">flavors</a> beyond the original, tweaked to fit the tastes of Hawaii locals, stateside Americans, and growing markets like China. Now consumers can choose from Teriyaki, Chorizo, Portuguese Sausage Seasoning, Tocino, Jalapeño, and more. So, if all this talk has you craving a sizzling slice of the American classic meat, here’s one of our favorite Spam recipes plus six more Hawaiian-inspired dishes to make alongside it.</p>
                    <h2>The largest Spam festival in the world.</h2>
                    <p>For the past 16 years, food festival Spam Jam Waikiki on the island of Oahu has showcased chefs putting innovative spins on Spam. Toby Tamaye, marketing director for the festival, says it’s the largest one-night food festival in the state, and Hormel recognizes it as the largest Spam festival in the world. What began as a block party among a few chefs has transformed into a massive event. In 2017, 35,000 visitors and locals attended the Jam, which now fills six blocks of Waikiki’s bustling Kalakaua Avenue.</p>
                    <blockquote>Spam is definitely a big part of casual dining and fast food. Our McDonald’s has Spam, and our Jack in the Box has Spam. But people usually cook it at home, so there’s not really a big demand when people go to restaurants for Spam.

                    <p>That all changes at Spam Jam, when chefs can go wild with the meat product. Traditional Spam musubi sits alongside innovative recipes drawing on every cuisine represented in the state. Tamaye says, “We have Spam dim sum, Spam katsu on a stick, Spam fries with dipping sauces. We have takoyaki and gyoza filled with Spam. We even have Spam popsicles, Spam cupcakes, Spam cheesecakes. We have Chinese, we have Mexican, we have local cuisine, we have Thai, we have Japanese.” Hormel even uses Spam Jam as a testing ground for new products before releasing them nationally. As Tamaye explains, “Half of the people there are local, and if they like it, Hormel knows it works.”</p>
                    <h2>Plan your travels around Spam.</h2>
                    <p>It may be a long time before mainlanders develop enough passion for Spam to incorporate the meat in holy matrimony, but Hawaiians are happy to school curious diners who want to hop on the bandwagon. Tamaye routinely fields inquiries from travelers all over the globe who are planning their next trip to Hawaii around Spam Jam. So if all of this Spam talk has you craving a legit Spam musubi or Spam cupcake, then you should start planning your trip now to visit the real home of all things Spam. </p>
